      "text": "This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding. The Supremacy Clause establishes that federal law takes precedence over state laws when there is a conflict. This principle of federal preemption means that state and local governments cannot pass laws that contradict federal statutes or the Constitution itself."
